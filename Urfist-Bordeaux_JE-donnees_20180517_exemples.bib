The walls were tested up to failure. Throughout the loading the deformations of the walls were recorded using a digital photogrammetric measurement system tracking the movement of 312 points per test unit.},

Cette enquête par questionnaire a été menée du 14 novembre 2017 au 12 janvier 2018 auprès du réseau d’acteurs de l’Apes. 75 réponses ont été recueillies. Les résultats montrent que ces acteurs ont un accès restreint aux productions scientifiques issues de leurs collaborations avec des chercheurs, ce qui leur pose des difficultés dans un nombre significatif de cas. Cependant, à travers les réponses des acteurs des pistes d’amélioration se dessinent par l’entremise d’une redéfinition plus large des relations entre acteurs et chercheurs. La structuration du jeu de données est explicitée dans le fichier Readme. Un poster a été réalisé à partir des réponses à cette enquête. Il est disponible dans Zenodo à l’adresse suivante : https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1174362     English description This dataset presents the results of a survey of the Apes (Acteurs pour une économie solidaire, Hauts-de-France, a network of organizations of social and solidarity economy in Northern France) and of the University library of Lille. This survey based on a questionnaire was led from the 14th of November 2017 to the 12th of January 2018 among the organizations of the Apes network. 75 answers were collected. Results indicate that these organizations have a limited-access to research products coming from research in which they were engaged. This causes difficulties to quite many of them. However, from the answers of these organizations some ways of improving the situation may be drawn, by changing in a broader way the relationship between these organizations and the researchers they are working with. The dataset organization is explained in the Readme file. A poster was designed from these survey results and is available in Zenodo at this URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1174362},
